# Travel Journal (Jurnal de calatorie)
This is the oldest project that I created using HTML and CSS during my 12th-grade year as part of my "atestat" project. 
The main page, which serves as the cover of the journal, was particularly challenging. I struggled with arranging the cloud and ensuring that the page was responsive. Although I managed to create a responsive design for most of the pages, there were some, such as the cover page, that presented difficulties and may not be completely adaptive.
